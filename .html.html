<p>
Just as the world increasingly becomes even more digital, the need for cybersecurity has grown too. Data breaches are a huge deal and expose the private information of both customers and companies. According to IBM, the average total cost of a data breach is $3.92 million. With so much on the line, it’s no surprise that companies are willing to pay handsomely for someone to protect their data.
Median salaries for cybersecurity experts can start at $80,000 for IT Security Consultants and can reach six figures for other positions such as a security director. The best way to start your path in cybersecurity is with, you guessed it, a bachelor’s
 degree in computer science, information technology, engineering, or another related field.

Like medical care, people still need to visit the dentist regardless of how the economy is doing. As baby boomers keep getting older, they’re going to require more dental care. The same can be said for the health-minded millennial generation.

Students will need an associate degree in dental hygiene to start a career as a dental hygienist. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts 11 percent annual growth in this important field over the next ten years. For a career as a dentist, you’ll need a bachelor’s degree followed by a Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) or Doctor of Medicine in Dentistry (DMD).

Careers for dentists are expected to grow by seven percent by 2028 and have a 2018 median pay that’s almost twice what you’d make as a dental hygienist ($156,240 as a dentist compared to $74,820 as a dental hygienist).

</h2>

<p>One important question to ask yourself when planning for a future-proof career is what services people are always going to need. Medical professionals are definitely at the top of the list. People will always need medical care and, while the technology we use to deliver some of that care is changing, the necessity for nurses, doctors, and medical professionals will always be there.

Depending on your field and which medical profession you want to pursue, there are a number of options for students. For those who value interacting with patients and want to become registered nurses (RNs), you’re going to need either an associate degree in nursing, a Bachelor of Science in nursing, or another accredited diploma from a nursing program. If you’re interested in becoming a practicing physician you’ll need a medical degree in your chosen field on top of your four-year degree.

Even better, students interested in working in a medical profession may be eligible for student loan forgiveness. It’s part of the FELS (Forgivable Education Loans for Service) Program where students can have some or all of their student loans forgiven as part of working in eligible professions within North Carolina. Examples of FELS eligible professions and programs include a wide range of nursing, allied health, and medical programs. Be sure to check carefully and see if your program is eligible for student loan forgiveness.
